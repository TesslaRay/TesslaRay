# Hello üëã

I'm **Cristian Valdivia Ram√≠rez**. I'm an Electrical Engineer and developer from <img src="./chile.svg" width="25"/> **Santiago, Chile.**

I dedicate myself to building technology in my laboratory where ideas come to life or die trying. It's a space to explore the unknown and challenge the established.

## What I Do

**Need help building a product, assembling a development team, or need technology consulting?**

I've spent many years creating products in areas like **IoT, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and artificial intelligence**. I've worked on small projects to products used by people around the world. In the process, I learned the basics of design and programming to bring my ideas to life. Additionally, I stand out for my ability to teach and lead high-performance teams.
